Hermes
======

The ΩF:∅ Foundation has announced plans to introduce a new communication protocol and associated software. The codename for this project is Hermes, known for being the Greek god of "travel, messengers, trade, thievery, cunning wiles, language, writing, diplomacy, athletics, and animal husbandry" [(1)]. We hope that systemfault's idea of deciding codenames after Greek mythological figures is followed in the future. As with all codenames, it can and most likely will be renamed in the future. Because sephr has objections to this name [(2)], we will have to change it later or we will most likely get executed.


Overview
--------

This section hopes to provide a basic overview of what seperates this project apart from other services and software such as Skype, Mumble, and IRC. The project is split up into the following sections:

* Protocol
* Server software
* Client software

[this section MUST be expanded with a brief description of the idea]


Technology
----------

* transOgg or Ogg container
* H.265 video
* Opus audio
* Text format based on some semantic format we make
